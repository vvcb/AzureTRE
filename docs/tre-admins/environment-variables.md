# Environment variables

!!! info
    The `.tfvars` file is intentionally not used. The `.env` file format is easier to parse, meaning we can use the values for bash scripts and other purposes.

## For shared management resources in `/devops/.env`

| <div style="width: 330px">Environment variable name</div> | Description |
| ------------------------- | ----------- |
| `LOCATION` | The Azure location (region) for all resources. |
| `MGMT_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME` | The shared resource group for all management resources, including the storage account. |
| `MGMT_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME` | The name of the storage account to hold the Terraform state and other deployment artifacts. |

| `ACR_NAME` | A globally unique name for the Azure Container Registry (ACR) that will be created to store deployment images. |
| `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | *Optional for manual deployment. If not specified the `az cli` selected subscription will be used.* The Azure subscription ID for all resources. |
| `ARM_CLIENT_ID` | *Optional for manual deployment without logged-in credentials.* The client whose azure identity will be used to deploy the solution. |
| `ARM_CLIENT_SECRET` | *Optional for manual deployment without logged-in credentials.* The password of the client defined in `ARM_CLIENT_ID`. |
| `ARM_TENANT_ID` | *Optional for manual deployment. If not specified the `az cli` selected subscription will be used.* The AAD tenant of the client defined in `ARM_CLIENT_ID`. |

## For Azure TRE instance in `/templates/core/.env`

| <div style="width: 330px">Environment variable name</div> | Description |
| ------------------------- | ----------- |
| `TRE_ID` | A globally unique identifier. `TRE_ID` can be found in the resource names of the Azure TRE instance; for example, a `TRE_ID` of `mytre-dev` will result in a resource group name for Azure TRE instance of `rg-mytre-dev`. This must be less than 12 characters. Allowed characters: Alphanumeric, underscores, and hyphens. |
| `TRE_URL`| This will be generated for you by populating your `TRE_ID`. This is used so that you can automatically register bundles |
| `CORE_ADDRESS_SPACE` | The address space for the Azure TRE core virtual network. `/22` or larger. |
| `TRE_ADDRESS_SPACE` | The address space for the whole TRE environment virtual network where workspaces networks will be created (can include the core network as well). E.g. `10.0.0.0/12`|
| `SWAGGER_UI_CLIENT_ID` | Generated when following [pre-deployment steps](./setup-instructions/pre-deployment-steps.md) guide. Client ID for swagger client to make requests. |
| `AAD_TENANT_ID` | Generated when following [pre-deployment steps](./setup-instructions/pre-deployment-steps.md) guide. Tenant id against which auth is performed. |

| `STATEFUL_RESOURCES_LOCKED` | If set to `false` locks on stateful resources won't be created. A recommended setting for developers. |
| `ENABLE_AIRLOCK_MALWARE_SCANNING` | If False, Airlock requests will skip the malware scanning stage. If set to True, Setting up a scanner manually is required! |
| `ENABLE_LOCAL_DEBUGGING` | Set to `false` by default. Setting this to `true` will ensure that Azure resources are accessible from your local development machine. (e.g. ServiceBus and Cosmos) |
| `PUBLIC_DEPLOYMENT_IP_ADDRESS` | The public IP address of the machine that is deploying TRE. (Your desktop or the build agents). In certain locations a dynamic script to retrieve this from [https://ipecho.net/plain](https://ipecho.net/plain) does not work. If this is the case, then you can 'hardcode' your IP. |
| `RESOURCE_PROCESSOR_VMSS_SKU` | The SKU of the VMMS to use for the resource processing VM. |
